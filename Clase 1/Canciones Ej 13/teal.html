<h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>I'll always remember the time that we met</p>
    <p>It was somebody's party</p>
    <p>You were wearing a black dress</p>
    <p>Clinging to shadows</p>
    <p>Chameleon-esque</p>
    <p>And we were together, when we were fifteen</p>
    <p>But nothing is real then, you know what I mean?</p>
    <p>I slept with that dancer, I didn't mean it</p>
    <p>It was all in a dream babe, all in a dream</p>
    <p>All in a dream</p>
    <p>Sorry</p>
    <p>And I hadn't seen you in a couple of years</p>
    <p>You'd been at the doctors</p>
    <p>You called me in tears</p>
    <p>"Jacob baby I'm broken, I can't be fixed</p>
    <p>They think it's my kidneys, they don't know what it is</p>
    <p>And how could this happen man, I'm just a kid</p>
    <p>I've got something to live for, and so much to give</p>
    <p>Now I live in a basement, a blade at my wrist</p>
    <p>I think this is over, I think this is it</p>
    <p>What if this is it?</p>
    <p>And all of your friends, they say that they need you</p>
    <p>When you need them they just get up and leave you</p>
    <p>One of them said "I don't care if this kills you"</p>
    <p>What if it did Katie?</p>
    <p>What if it killed her?</p>
    <p>What would you do then?</p>
    <p>Hope you'd be sorry</p>
    <p>Hope you'd go to her grave, apologize for me</p>
    <p>All the time that she gave you</p>
    <p>Every time you were worried</p>
    <p>That's 'cause she was your friend</p>
    <p>Hope that you're sorry, yeah</p>
    <p>Truly</p>
    <p>And when I was using, she still said she loved me</p>
    <p>Be more of a human, less of a junkie</p>
    <p>You gotta gift man, go and be something</p>
    <p>If I was in your shoes, I would be jumping</p>
    <p>And that's when I felt it, it conquered my heart</p>
    <p>It was the light of a candle, in the depths of the dark</p>
    <p>And there was a fire, it danced in your eyes</p>
    <p>A beautiful world and a beautiful mind</p>
    <p>A beautiful mind</p>
    <p>A beautiful mind</p>
    <p>A beautiful mind</p>
    <p>You've got a beautiful mind</p>
