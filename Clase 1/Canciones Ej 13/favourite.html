    <h2>Letra</h2>
<p>Did you know</p>
<p>I could claim the dreamer from the dream?</p>
<p>Make you feel</p>
<p>Everything you've never even seen</p>
<p>Yeah, it's been</p>
<p>A long, a long, a long, a long, a long-long</p>
<p>You been my</p>
<p>Favourite for a long time</p>
<p>Stitch and fall</p>
<p>The faces rearranged</p>
<p>You will see</p>
<p>Beauty give the way to something strange</p>
<p>Yeah, it's been</p>
<p>A long, a long, a long, a long, a long-long</p>
<p>You been my</p>
<p>Favourite for a long time</p>
<p>Well, look who's just the newest clown</p>
<p>35 hours coming down</p>
<p>How the sun shines on new pavement</p>
<p>And you don't even feel it</p>
<p>It's a cry far from bed radios</p>
<p>And days spent playing football indoors</p>
<p>When they painted town with Thatcher</p>
<p>And they never even wanted to know ya</p>
<p>Feel alone?</p>
<p>I can split the sunshine to the day</p>
<p>Yeah, and</p>
<p>Stick your heart to everything you say</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>To be gone, be gone, be gone, be gone, be gone</p>
<p>You been my favourite for a long time</p>
<p>You been my favourite for a long time</p>
<p>Favourite for a long time</p>
<p>Favourite for a long time</p>
<p>Favourite for a long time</p>
<p>(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa) all the pieces last forever</p>
<p>(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa) all the pieces last forever</p>
<p>(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa) and all the pieces</p>
<p>Dara-dara-dara-dara-dara</p>
<p>(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa) and all the pieces</p>
<p>Dara-da, dara-da</p>
<p>Did you know</p>
<p>Cities on the side are often strange?</p>
<p>Yeah, and now</p>
<p>Every time you blink, you feel it change</p>
<p>And it's been</p>
<p>A long, a long, a long, a long, long-long</p>
<p>You've been my</p>
<p>Favourite for a while</p>
<p>Ah, it makes sense when you understand</p>
<p>The misery made me another marked man</p>
<p>And I'm always looking over my shoulder</p>
<p>And each new day, I get another year older</p>
<p>Shoulder bound to the frame of a door?</p>
<p>Chewed into shape like a stone on the shore</p>
<p>But if there was lightning in me</p>
<p>You'd know who it was for</p>
<p>Did you know</p>
<p>I could claim the dreamer from the dream?</p>
<p>Make you feel</p>
<p>Everything you've never even seen</p>
<p>Yeah, it's been</p>
<p>A long, a long, a long, a long, long-long</p>
<p>You been my</p>
<p>Favourite for a long time</p>
<p>You been my favourite for a long time</p>
<p>You been my favourite for a long time</p>
<p>You been my favourite for a long time</p>
